这是一座消耗粒子驱动的高科技变异农场实验室，专为突破植物生长极限而生！在这里，你的复制人只需放入普通原始种子，就能通过精密的辐射培育流程，获得拥有独特强力特性的稀有变异种子，为你的基地发展注入全新活力与无限可能！
This is a high-tech mutation farm lab powered by particle consumption, designed to break through the limits of plant growth! Here, your duplicants only need to put in ordinary raw seeds, and through a precise radiation cultivation process, they can obtain rare mutated seeds with unique and powerful traits, injecting new vitality and infinite possibilities into the development of your base!
<h2>新增建筑 New Buildings</h2>
<h3>1. 变异农场试验台 Mutation Farm Test Bench</h3>

作为整个实验室的核心设备，通过消耗辐射粒子，为普通种子提供稳定的变异培育环境。只需将原始种子放入，经过培育周期后，即可收获多种带有随机独特特性的变异种子，是开启变异种植的基础。
As the core equipment of the entire lab, it consumes radiation particles to provide a stable mutation cultivation environment for ordinary seeds. Simply put the raw seeds in, and after the cultivation cycle, you can harvest a variety of mutated seeds with random unique traits—it is the foundation for starting mutation planting.
<h3>2. 辐射种植砖 Radiation Cultivation Tile</h3>
专为变异植物生长设计的特殊种植砖，通过持续消耗铀矿，为种植在其上的变异植物提供稳定且适宜的辐射生长环境，确保变异植物能正常生长。
A special cultivation tile designed for the growth of mutated plants. By continuously consuming uranium ore, it provides a stable and suitable radiation growth environment for the mutated plants planted on it, ensuring their normal growth.
<h3>3. 辐射灯带 Radiation Light Strip</h3>
专为辐射供给设计的设备，消耗辐射粒子即可运行。开启后，会在灯带下方的一定范围内形成辐射环境，精准满足变异植物对辐射的生长需求。
A device designed specifically for radiation supply, which can operate by consuming radiation particles. When turned on, it will form a uniform radiation environment within a certain range below the light strip, accurately meeting the radiation growth needs of mutated plants.
<h3>4. 辐射种植砖配件 Radiation Cultivation Tile Accessory</h3>
可直接建造在辐射种植砖底部的辅助设备，通过消耗辐射粒子，向上方种植砖上的植物精准输送辐射能量。其优势在于能进一步强化辐射环境的稳定性，同时不额外占用基地水平空间，让基地布局更灵活。
An auxiliary device that can be directly built at the bottom of the radiation cultivation tile. It accurately transmits radiation energy to the plants on the upper cultivation tile by consuming radiation particles. Its advantage is that it can further enhance the stability of the radiation environment without occupying additional horizontal space of the base, making the base layout more flexible.

<h2>新增植物变异品种</h2>
<h3>1. 辐光菌 Actinobacteria</h3>
极具实用价值的变异真菌，生长过程中会持续释放温和的光照与低剂量辐射。光照可替代传统光源为基地照明，低剂量辐射则可用来杀菌，是打造自给自足型种植区的理想选择。
A highly practical mutated fungus that continuously emits mild light and low-dose radiation during growth. The light can replace traditional light sources to illuminate the base, and the low-dose radiation can be used for sterilization, making it an ideal choice for creating a self-sufficient planting area.
<h3>2. 辐射籽 Radiation Resist Seed</h3>
特殊的变异植物副产品，复制人服用后能立即清除体内所有辐射剂量，治愈辐射病，同时获得一段时间的辐射抗性。在辐射环境密集的区域，它能为复制人的生命安全提供关键保障，大幅降低医疗压力。
A special by-product of mutated plants. After being taken by duplicants, it can immediately clear all radiation doses in the body, cure radiation sickness, and obtain radiation resistance for a period of time. In areas with dense radiation environments, it can provide key protection for the life safety of duplicants and greatly reduce medical pressure.
<h3>3. 原油富集 Crude Oil-Enriched</h3>
堪称基地的“空气净化器”与“能源制造机”！它能高效吸收空气中的二氧化碳，将其转化为原油并存储在体内。收获后可提取原油，既解决了基地二氧化碳超标问题，又为能源生产提供了稳定的原料来源，实现环保与能源双赢。
It can be called the "air purifier" and "energy maker" of the base! It can efficiently absorb carbon dioxide in the air and convert it into crude oil for storage in the body. Crude oil can be extracted after harvesting, which not only solves the problem of excessive carbon dioxide in the base but also provides a stable raw material source for energy production, achieving a win-win situation for environmental protection and energy.
